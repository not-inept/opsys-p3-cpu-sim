A CPU Scheduling and memory management simulator.

TODO: (1) Implement round-robin scheduling.
TODO: (1) Implement memory allocation/deallocation with dynamic partioning scheme.
TODO: (1) Implement default 256 memory units.
TODO: (2) Implement defragmentation, out of memory error with t_memmove as the time to move one unit of memory and process reallocation.
TODO: (2) Implement memory output with 32 units per line.
TODO: (2) Integrate memory via requiring allocation before a process first enters the cpu.
TODO: (2) Integrate memory via forcing deallocation after a process completes.
TODO: (2) Implement "first-fit", "next-fit", and "best-fit" memory allocation schemes.
TODO: (3) Suspend process during memory defragmentation.
TODO: (4) Ensure continued functionality of SRT scheduling.
